It's a program that can do brute force url.
Unlike normal programs, it can do it asynchronizely.
In order to make sure the accuracy, we limit the Promise to 10 at most.
Take break3 the first flag for example: we need to brute force 9999 url and if it is normal Python, it takes more than 2 hours.
But using this program, it takes around 10 minutes.
